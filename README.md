Created using PlatformIO for VSCode 
and Android Studio

Componenets I used:
- Esp32 Wroom32D
- White LED strip aprox 1.5m
- 12v, 2A PSU
- Lm2596 DC-DC converter
- IRLB8721 MOSFET
- Resistors(TODO: Values)
- Switch, breadboard... 


TODO:
- create README
- when turning on/off do it gradually
- add condensator between psu and microcontroller
  

Printing
- Part2 needs to be a little flexible so keep that in mind when printing. I used PETG 

COMPILING:
- Create config.cpp from config.cpp.template
- Change values in includes/config.h also change address in mobile app as it is hardcoded
